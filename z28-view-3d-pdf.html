I’m by no means an expert but I’d like to share the knowledge I’ve gained over that time, often asking about things on this very subreddit. A lot of people here helped me in many cases so I thought it would be nice to give back to the community and do my part. Considering how often we get questions on how to pick up archery or what gear should one buy first, I thought we could use a guide summing some of those.
