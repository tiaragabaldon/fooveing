I have a DS-2CD2442FWD-IW running V5.4.5 build 170124 that I'd like to bump up to the next available version. I already have the correct firmware file downloaded, but whenever I click the browse button under Maintenance gt Upgrade gt Upgrade Firware to select and upload the file to the camera, nothing happens and it won't let me manually type in a file path into the text box either. I've tried this in Chrome, Firefox, and IE and the behavior is the same in each. Am I missing something. Can anyone please confirm if they have this configuration working? The issue is that the admin plugin (to view recordings) no longer works as it requires the Google WebM for IE plugin which doesn't appear to work in 1709. https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webm/issues/detail?id=1477ampcan=2ampstart=0ampnum=100ampq=1709ampcolspec=ID%20Pri%20mstone%20ReleaseBlock%20Type%20Component%20Status%20Owner%20Summaryampgroupby=ampsort= This is a read speed bump for us now, Cisco is useless My boss asked me to configure an additional old Camera DVR for two additional non-ip cameras. Its your standard off-brand chinese 4 CH DVR from around 2011. The WebUI doesn't even allow you to configure the device, all of that must be done locally on the device with a keyboard/mouse. My biggest problem at the moment is that the WebUI for viewing uses a old Quicktime ActiveX plugin which it seems no modern browser will allow to run or install. However the exact issue I think it that I don't.

Going to WSUS gt Updates gt Import Updates launches IE and tries to open the MS Update Catalog. However, it gives the message: "To use this website, you browser must have the user data persistence setting enabled." I follow the steps to enable the setting but the same message keeps appearing. I can open the MS Update Catalog directly in IE but it only give's the option. --- "this would be amazing for the simple reason that it would (give an option to) simplify mining for ANYONE. Imagine if my mum, who can turn on a computer and click Google Chrome but not much else, could simply click a link in her web browser and then she is mining, helping the orphans/charity, supporting the network, and possibly earning for herself. If it could be set up to either enter your BBP address OR directly mine to the charity address then that would be perfect. Hey all, I've played around in Linux for years on and off, have almost everything I own dual booted with some flavor or another. I would love to be able to make some of those devices straight up Linux boxes, however I use the windows side for work.

Hello, This project seems to really cool and I'm trying to add in a cheap ebay chinese IP camera. It the only IP camera I currently have at the moment. The camera seems to work "ok". The camera's ebay description is "HD 1.0MP 720P IP Camera P2P Onvif Network CCTV Outdoor Security IR Night Vision"  After setting up the camera, I disovered it required MS IE with some ActiveX controls. So I am able to get to the camera from a windows7 VM. After running Windows IE, it downloaded "NewActiv. For Windows 8/8.1/10+ Windows now includes the ActiveX version of Adobe Flash Player Plugin and installs it via Windows update. They do a okay job of keeping it up to date and usually release the patch the day or day after Adobe releases theirs, or during Update Tuesday patching. This week, they made a whoopsie. Last weeks patch, KB3087916, https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3087916 included the Debugging version of flash by accident. Friday afternoon I started getting reports from those. 
(x-post from /r/linux4noobs) Hey all, I've played around in Linux for years on and off, have almost everything I own dual booted with some flavor or another.

As a MSP, there are certain things we traditionally never deal with for our clients, leaving it to be implemented by other vendors. Things like phone systems, access control, camera DVR, etc. I've noticed that typically vendors install DVRs that truly suck in every way. The web GUIs use IE activex plugins, they require a large group of non-consecutive ports to be forwarded to view the cameras outside the network, and require flaky old windows GUIs to pull recordings out of the DVR. Forget. Hey guys, I've been Googling around and really haven't found any useful answers to this. We heavily rely on "Datasheet mode" in our SharePoint site at work. This uses the Microsoft Access database connector plugin to display a spreadsheet inside of IE. However, since we have licenses for the full Office suite, we've just been installing it that way rather than using the free plugin. Office 2010 and 2013 work perfectly fine, even on Windows 10, never had any issues with their automatic updat. I've seen a few posts about people starting their CCNAS (Sec) studies, along with replies wishing good luck with CCP. CCP is an awful program, while at the same time, a wonderful program. The good is that when it works, it can dump 300 commands into your device in moments and makes it very easy to create site-to-site and DMVPN. The bad is that is is written in java, flash, Internet Explorer and is mandatory to pass the exam. Having messed around with it for quite 1. Merchant customer downloads a js file 2. On windows: the js file determines if Dogecoin was installed on the computer or not: looks for an activeX browser component if IE, or a browser plugin if FF 3. If Dogecoin is installed then the browser is redirected to an URL with a special transport, for example: doge://. 4. The browser invokes the handler (provided by the Dogecoin client). This includes starting up the exe if it is not already running. 5. Dogecoin.exe uses the rest of the special. Hi folks, This is a silly question that I'm fairly certain I know the answer to, but I wanted to double check. Does migrating from the 32-bit to the 64-bit version of Chrome have any issues with support for plugins or extensions? I ask because one of the products I support at the office, which was IE-only, wouldn't work with 64-bit IE because some of the plugins were never released in 64-bit versions. Now, those were ActiveX plugins, which obviously isn't an issue in Chrome Hi Everyone, I am currently trying to understand why certain Windows 7 clients are unable to connect to remote machines via RDWeb. Typically the process should be as follows: 1. Browse to RDWeb using Internet Explorer. 2. Log in with your domain credentials 3. Allow the ActiveX plugin 4. Type your computer name and click connect. 5. Enter your domain credentials once more. 6. Verify certificate 7. You're in! Keep in mind that I am referring to clients here as the computers sendi. The current system setup here is a no-name dedicated DVR box running Linux, but some genius has hard-wrapped the output inside an ActiveX plugin so it's as good as useless for most users unless they are coming from Windows with IE. I've been tasked with acquiring and setting up the new system. The only requirements are that is be capable of 10+ camera inputs and able to output an open protocol stream that any device can view/interact with. I've had a look at all the usual online stores 
Whenever I play something with sound in Chrome, be it a YouTube video or a streaming service like Amazon or Netflix, the sound is distorted with skipping and popping almost like I'm listening to a dirty record. Sound from other sources (VLC media player, IE9, Winamp, games, etc) is completely fine. Things I have tried: - Disabling the flash plugin at Chrome://plugins - Uninstalling/reinstalling my flash system plugin and activeX - Uninstalling/reinstalling Chrome itself - Uninstalling/rein. So many questions in the title but I'm hoping people with the same use case as myself will respond. So hitting F12 allows you to change the user-agent string to IE 8 but when trying to launch the activex plugin for remote desktop, I just get a blank popup window with the 2008R2 logo. Anyone come across this and have any thoughts on other steps Plug-in For Hosting ActiveX Controls Introduction.

As part of our ongoing commitment to delivering a more secure browser, starting September 9th Internet Explorer will block out-of-date ActiveX controls. There is no solution to this problem.
